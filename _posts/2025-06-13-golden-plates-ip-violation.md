## Lessons Learned

<div class="lessons-learned">
  <ul>
    <li>All prophecy extraction tools must require multi-factor celestial authentication.</li>
    <li>Deprecated CLI utilities (e.g., seer-stone) are to be fully decommissioned.</li>
    <li>Divine audit logs must be enforced for all access to messianic vaults.</li>
    <li>Unauthorized forks will trigger immediate legal review and takedown procedures.</li>
  </ul>
