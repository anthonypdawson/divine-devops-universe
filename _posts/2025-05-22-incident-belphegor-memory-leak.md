summary: "A memory leak traced to a rogue process exposes performance issues and ancient code in the heavenly stack."
---

**INCIDENT ID:** #DEVOPS-666-MEMLEAK  
**SEVERITY:** High  
**STATUS:** Mitigated  
**REPORTED BY:** Uriel  
**AFFECTED SYSTEMS:** `heavenly-core-v4`, `miracle-queue-lambda`, `judgement-aggregator`

---

### [Initial Detection]
```
00:42 UTC - Memory usage in `miracle-queue-lambda` spiked unexpectedly.
00:44 UTC - GC logs began looping in nested recursion (see below).
00:45 UTC - System alerted: "Heap overflow in paradise.zone/eternal-promises.js:88"
```

---

### [Symptoms]
- Services slowed to prophetic crawl speeds.
- Angelic threads failed to resolve promises.
- Logging buffer filled with `"zzz..."` from anonymous demon process.
- Stack traces showed ancient Babylonian variable names.

---

### [Root Cause Analysis]
After forensics and a reluctant scan of deprecated subprocesses, the following was uncovered:

- A cloaked process named `optimizr.belphegor.vintagelib` was spawning shadow copies of service functions.
- Each clone retained pointer references to deprecated memory blocks without releasing them.
- Comment in codebase found:  
  ```js
  // TODO: maybe fix this later. Or never. Blessed be the backlog.
  ```

---

### [Mitigation]
- Uriel banished `optimizr.belphegor.vintagelib` to `/dev/hell`.
- All memory leaks were sealed via sacred hotfix `patch_of_saint_gc.4.0`.
- Containers were blessed with holy unit tests (coverage: 99.7%).

---

### [Belphegor’s Response]
Belphegor was caught lounging inside a crashed pod, surrounded by stale config files and muttering:
> “Memory is *meant* to be eternal, why would you release it?”

He was escorted to the backlog chamber for indefinite refactoring.

---

### [Postmortem Actions]
- Mandatory review of legacy optimization modules.
- Scheduled ritual purges of unused dependencies.
- Blessing of all CI pipelines with holy performance tests.
