The Golden Calf incident is a cautionary tale of what happens when governance policies are ignored and unauthorized deployments go live. 

Here's the full incident report from the PaganOS team.

**> INCIDENT: UNAUTHORIZED DEPLOYMENT - GOLDEN CALF**

**Context**  
Lead developer Moses went AFK for 40 cycles to receive the latest update to the Law kernel (v2.0 tablets) from the cloud provider (Mount Sinai).

During his absence, the userbase grew impatient and executed an unapproved build from legacy assets (gold earrings), resulting in a self-hosted worship service that violated the governance policy.
