**FROM:** HeavenOps Internal Audit Division  
**TO:** All Departments, Multifaith Integration Office  
**SUBJECT:** *Rasputin Deployment a Catastrophic Success*

---

## Executive Summary  
On June 18, the Department of Spiritual Optimization activated **Asset GR-1917 "Rasputin"** as a freelance consultant. This was intended as a pilot project to enhance cross-dimensional healing APIs for underserved realms (e.g., Purgatory, New Jersey). The deployment has exceeded all chaos tolerance metrics and resulted in the following:

- Five unauthorized miracles logged before onboarding was complete.  
- Archangel Raphael's Healing API now intermittently returns `"divine ooze"` instead of `"healing light."`  
- Twelve seraphim converted to “Orthodox Adjacent Hedonism.”  
- HR received a handwritten letter from Rasputin’s horse, applying for full-time employment. The letter rhymed.

## Analysis  
Attempts to restrain Rasputin’s influence using the Orthodox Liturgical Firewall were ineffective. He seduced it with interpretive dance. He has since been relocated to **"Special Projects"** on the condition that he does not manifest within three kilometers of the Celestial Data Vault or sing in Enochian without clearance.

---

## Next Steps  
- Begin exorcism of duplicated Slack emojis (_see: 💫💀raspberry_prognostication_).
- Patch healing API to remove embedded folk spells.
- Interview Rasputin’s horse (now trending in four dimensions).
- Revoke Rasputin's access to the Celestial Data Vault's karaoke machine.
- Implement goat-proof debugging tools.

### Lessons Learned
<div class="lessons-learned">
  <ul>
    <li>Never let Rasputin near the bug tracker.</li>
    <li>Interpretive dance is not a valid firewall bypass method.</li>
    <li>Always A/B test miracles before deployment.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
