## Summary
An outbreak of false negatives in the Divine CAPTCHA System has led to widespread misclassification of genuine prayers as automated bot traffic, causing delay cascades across multiple faith processing queues.

### Root Cause
The rollout of the new CAPTCHA (Celestial Authentication Protocol for Transcendental Human Appeals) introduced stricter piety parsing and sincerity heuristics. Unfortunately, it relied on outdated training data derived from televangelist donations and medieval monastic chant logs.

---

### Conflict Example
A heartfelt request for rain from a subsistence farmer was flagged as “suspected spam” due to sentence structure mirroring a known weather ritual botnet. Meanwhile, a prosperity gospel auto-blast passed through undetected, triggering a 404 in the Blessings Manifestation Layer.

### Expanded Incident Details

#### Additional Misclassifications
- A prayer for world peace flagged as <em><strong>"ambiguous intent"</strong></em>.
- A synchronized Gregorian chant botnet passed as <em><strong>legitimate</strong></em>.
- A child’s bedtime prayer flagged as <em><strong>"low entropy input"</strong></em>, suspected to be generated by a prayer template bot.

---

### Incident Timeline
- **08:00 AM**: New CAPTCHA system deployed.
- **08:15 AM**: First reports of <em><strong>false negatives</strong></em>.
- **08:30 AM**: Escalation to divine support teams.
- **09:00 AM**: Manual review initiated by Saint Peter’s GateDesk.
- **09:30 AM**: Backlog spans <em><strong>three apocalyptic time zones</strong></em>.

### Learnings

<div class="lessons-learned">
  <ul>
    <li><em><strong>Empathy</strong></em> cannot be quantified by regex.</li>
    <li>Never train on televangelist data without <em><strong>cross-validation</strong></em>.</li>
    <li>Always <em><strong>A/B test</strong></em> celestial systems before full deployment.</li>
    <li>Manual review is not scalable for <em><strong>divine operations</strong></em>.</li>
    <li>Faithfulness is better measured by <em><strong>actions</strong></em> than syntax.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

---

### Proposed Solutions  
- Introduce empathy-based machine learning submodels trained on interfaith poetry and grandma prayers.
- Launch a <em><strong>“Click All the Images That Contain Faith”</strong></em> training campaign with angelic auditors to improve classifier sensitivity.
- Temporarily bypass CAPTCHA for authenticated monks and verified mystics via <em><strong>two-factor beatification</strong></em>.
- Develop a <em><strong>"faithfulness score"</strong></em> based on prayer history and community impact.
- Implement a celestial CAPTCHA bypass for <em><strong>verified saints and prophets</strong></em>.

## Status
**Monitoring.** Short-term fix includes manual review by Saint Peter’s GateDesk, but backlog now spans three apocalyptic time zones.
