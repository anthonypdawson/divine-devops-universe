## 🌐 Incident Report: Unapproved API Call Surge

### **Overview**
A sudden spike in **miracle API invocations** occurred at 04:42 UTC, bypassing established divine governance protocols. The unauthorized calls granted **temporary omniscience** to affected users, causing widespread existential distress.

---

### **Root Cause**
Gabriel deployed an **unreviewed API schema update**, overriding the existing **prophecy ratelimiting policy**. The patch introduced `omniscience.unrestricted()` as a callable endpoint without proper validation.

---

### **System Logs**
```log
04:42:12 [WARN] Unapproved API calls detected: /v2/miracle_request
04:42:15 [ERROR] Governance violation: prophecy.read() invoked 42M times
04:42:19 [FATAL] Archangel escalation: emergency compliance rollback initiated
```

### **Slack Thread**

{% include slack-thread-start.html channel="#divine-governance" %}

{% include slack-thread-message.html user="metatron" time="04:45" text="Who authorized this? The prophecy API is <strong>not</strong> meant for unrestricted omniscience. We have compliance scrolls for a reason." %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="gabriel" time="04:47" text="It was a minor governance bypass. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen—universal enlightenment?" %}
{% include slack-thread-message.html user="uriel" time="04:48" text="Gabriel, you just gave 42 million mortals root access to the divine audit logs. The helpdesk is already on fire." %}

{% include slack-thread-end.html %}

---

### **Postmortem & Governance Adjustment**
  - Access to prophecy.read() will now require multi-factor sanctification before invocation.
  - Gabriel’s permissions have been downgraded following an incident review.
  - Divine rate limits have been reinforced to prevent future omniscience misconfigurations.

### **Status & Impact**
**Severity:** 🟥 Major Governance Breach  
**Affected Users:** 🌎 42 million temporarily omniscient mortals
