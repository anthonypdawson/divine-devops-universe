### Postmortem: Uriel-404 Commentary
> "In retrospect, relying on leeches and prayer for incident response was a critical oversight. Next time, we’ll add a rat toggle flag."

### Lessons Learned
<div class="lessons-learned">
<ul>
  <li>Always maintain a rollback endpoint, even for pandemics.</li>
  <li>Never underestimate the impact of rat-based malware vectors.</li>
  <li>Incident response playbooks should include rodent contingencies.</li>
  <li>Faith-based debugging is not a substitute for root cause analysis.</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Impact
- EuroOps experienced 60%+ downtime for all users and services.
- PeasantDB replication was corrupted by flea-injection events.
- Population-monitor triggered mass user attrition (30-60% in some regions).
- Rat population increased by 9000%.
- Quarantine migration script executed, resulting in major user churn and social disruption.
